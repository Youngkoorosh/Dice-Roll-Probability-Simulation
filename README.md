# Dice-Roll-Probability-Simulation
This project simulates a large number of dice rolls to observe the frequency distribution of each face (1 through 6) and visualize the results using Matplotlib. The goal is to empirically verify if each side of a fair die has an approximately equal probability of landing face up.
