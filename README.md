# Dice Roll Probability Simulation

This project simulates a large number of dice rolls to observe the frequency distribution of each face (1 through 6) and visualize the results using Matplotlib. The goal is to empirically verify if each side of a fair die has an approximately equal probability of landing face up.

## Project Description

In probability theory, a fair six-sided die is expected to have an equal chance (1/6 or approximately 16.67%) of landing on any of its faces. However, in practice, random events can sometimes show slight deviations. This simulation aims to:

1.  **Simulate** a large number of dice rolls (e.g., 10,000 or more).
2.  **Count** the occurrences of each face (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
3.  **Calculate** the percentage of times each face appeared.
4.  **Visualize** these percentages using a bar chart (histogram-like representation) to easily compare the observed frequencies against theoretical probabilities.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dice-roll-probability-simulation.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dice-roll-probability-simulation.git)
    cd dice-roll-probability-simulation
    ```
2.  **Ensure you have Python installed** (Python 3.x is recommended).
3.  **Install the necessary libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib
    ```
4.  **Run the simulation script:**
    ```bash
    python dice_simulation.py
    ```
    (Assuming your Python script is named `dice_simulation.py`)

## Expected Output

The script will print the calculated percentages for each die face in the console. Additionally, a bar chart will be displayed, showing the percentage distribution. For a sufficiently large number of rolls, you should observe that the bars are roughly of equal height, converging towards 16.67% for each face, demonstrating the law of large numbers.
